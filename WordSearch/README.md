## Logics
The logic behind the verticle and horizontal is to make a long string for each verticle and horizontal, combining the rows and columns into one single line. Then from there, we do a search index to find the first letter of the words were trying to find. And then it moves to the next index to see if its the next letter of the word were trying to find and so on. 

For the diagnals, we do the exact thing with the verticle and horizontals, except instead of doing it one letter right after another. We do the currentIndex +/- (logic number). Depending on what direction it's going, the logic number is going to be different.
